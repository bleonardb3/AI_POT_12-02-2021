# Lab-5: Create a COVID-19 Dashboard using Cognos Dashboard Embedded

## Introduction

This lab will build a Cognos Dashboard Embedded dashboard to display COVID-19 data.

## Objectives

The goal of the lab is to familiarize the user with the use of the Cognos Dashboard Embedded service within Watson Studio.  We will be creating a dashboard similar to one on the IBM & Weather Channel COVID-19 Dashboard. IBM created a data fabric pulled from state and local governments as well as the World Health Organization. Where the public dashboard updates dynamically based on daily data pulls, we will use an extracted data table for the lab to build visualizations for a specific set of dates.
After completing this lab, you will be familiar with building dashboards using the Cognos Dashboard Embedded service in Watson Studio.

1. Download COVID-19 statistics data set
