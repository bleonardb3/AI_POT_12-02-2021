# Hands-On Workshop on AI, NLP, and Optimization

## Introduction
Many of the use cases in the government and public sector involve analyzing natural language text data.  This workshop will teach you how you can use natural language processing (NLP) features to efficiently analyze large amounts of text to produce actionable insights.  We will also teach you how to create chat-bots to understand constituent’s questions and provide appropriate answers.  Finally, we will discuss the use of Optimization and teach you how to optimally allocate resources which is key to many agencies’ activities.   The workshop is based around an example COVID-19 set of use cases.

The purpose of this training session is to teach attendees how to combine different technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and optimization to support the above capabilities. The training event is structured, through a series of hands-on labs  to demonstrate how these technologies can be combined to develop solutions that can augment planners’ abilities to understand, reason, and act on COVID-19 information and events at scale and speed.

## Objectives 
In this workshop, the attendees will learn how to: 
1. extract information from text and create knowledge to inform planners about events
1. create 'chat-bots' that act on this knowledge to answer peoples'questions
1. analyze current drivers to forecast future conditions
1. develop optimized approaches based on forecasted conditions
1. develop dashboards to provide insights to planners. 

# Labs
[Lab-0](Lab-0) - In this lab, we will setup the Watson Studio environment. 

[Lab-1](Lab-1) - In this lab, we will develop socioeconomic annotators to extract domain-specific information. 

[Lab-2](Lab-2) - In this lab, we will create a knowledge management system (KMS), ingest data, train the KMS to generate knowledge and synthesize a COVID-19 stability index

[Lab-3](Lab-3) - In this lab, we will develop a COVID-19 Chatbot Assistant to answer questions about COVID-19. 

[Lab-4](Lab-4) - In this lab, we will forecast the demand for resources, and then optimally allocate these resources based on the demand.   

[Lab-5](Lab-5) - In this lab, we will implement a dashboard that display COVID-19 statistics
