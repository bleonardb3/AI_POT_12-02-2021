# Lab-4: Predictive Analytics and Decision Optimization

## Introduction
This lab will introduce users to the use of IBM\'s predictive analytics
and decision optimization technologies to solve COVID-19 problems. The
coronavirus has infected millions of people leading to severe illness
symptoms resulting in deaths totalling in the hundreds of thousands. 
During the initial outbreak not all areas were affected the same. Hospitals located in
COVID-19 epidemic outbreak locations were overwhelmed with sick and
dying patients. This lab will apply predictive analytics to analyze
different factors among people to predict future COVID-19 infection
rates in an area. Based on areas predicted to have high COVID-19
infections -- this lab will apply optimization techniques to optimize
the planning of transferring COVID-19 patients from hospitals located in
epidemic areas to hospitals with less COVID-19 patients. Our hope is to
educate people who are involved in the COVID-19 response decision-making
process, in applying IBM\'s predictive and optimization technologies to
help them improve planning and responding to the next wave of COVID-19
cases.

## Objectives
The goal of this lab is to educate users on how to apply IBM predictive
analytics and optimization tools to different applications of COVID-19
such as (1) predicting future infections and (2) optimizing response for
better decision making. Students will use Watson Studio to load and step
through a notebook that applies Decision Optimization to optimize the
transport of affected people between hospitals to avoid being
over capacity. Working through this notebook -- we intend for students to learn
these skills.

1.  Learn how to load data form different places (departments, current
    situation, etc) to be used for analysis.

2.  Learn how to represent the current situation on a map using folium.
    folium makes it easy to visualize data that\'s been manipulated in
    Python on an interactive leaflet map. 

3.  Learn how to use a LinearRegression from sklearn to predict new
    cases for each department.

4.  Learn how to use Decision Optimization to model and optimize patient
    transfers.

5.  Learn how to use folium to display the optimized future patient
    transfers plan i.e. all the transfers from the solution.
